Wordpress API
Wordpress is a blogging and website platform. Wordpress uses a REST API, and this helps Wordpress 
users connect and access their feeds from other websites and applications, as well as include things
like widgets and other feeds from outside sources on their Wordpress site. A Wordpress user can use
their API to retrieve ('GET'), post, edit/update ('PUT'), or delete almost any resource from
the server. API is kind of confusing and complicated, and with a website like Wordpress, the function-
ality is quite huge so there are many more ways in which you could use or access information using
the Wordpress API. You can read more here: https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/wordpress-rest-api/
